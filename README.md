## Software Engineer

I'm committed to creating appealing apps and helping people learn how to code. I develop computer programs and full-stack applications majorly with Nodejs and Python, and sometimes publish articles on technical topics. While I love fantasy and fiction at leisure, I find computer programming to be the most interesting activity. I always strive for perfection in all of the projects that I work on; from type-safety to code composition, reuseability, efficiency, simplicity, and scalability. I believe every computer program should be error-safe and intuitive.
